'''
The error occurs when we have a list of numbers all less than 0. Our starting value for max_number is 0 and so our function will always return 0 erroneously for such lists.

To fix, we can simply set max_number's starting value to the first element (or any element) of the numbers listâ€”this is done in line 4.

Alternatively we can set max_number's starting value to the smallest number that Python knows, but that feels like a weird approach.
